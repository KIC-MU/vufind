# Uncomment the following lines to track history of indexing times for RSS feeds,
# OAI-PMH server and other updates.  The parameter to these functions must be the

# IMPORTANT: Indexing this extra information will make extra database calls during

# Uncomment the following line to index full text from URLs found in your MARC

# text, HTML, etc.) The first parameter is a fieldspec showing which fields to use

# matching the specified suffix will be indexed.  Note that this functionality
# depends on a full text tool being installed on your system.  See the wiki for

# Additionally, you will need to make sure articles have a format value of "Article."
